Project Plan: Abdullah's Course Enrollment & Grade Management System
 Start Date: May 13, 2025
 Updated: May 24, 2025
 Estimated Completion: September 7, 2025 (17 weeks, 119 days)

PHASE 1 — PLAN FINALIZATION & INITIALIZATION (May 13–16)
Goals:
Finalize architectural blueprint


Set up GitHub repo with 3 main branches: dev, staging, main


Establish clean branch-based working tree


Draft and push PROJECT_PLAN_V1.2 and GOALS_AND_ROADMAP_V1.2.md


Output:
Branches created and merged


Planning committed under /planning


Initial roadmap committed and version-tracked



PHASE 2 — DEV ENVIRONMENT BUILD + AUTOMATION SETUP (May 17 – June 7)
Stack:
JHipster (gateway, microservices)


Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.4.x


PostgreSQL via Docker (local dev)


R2DBC, Maven, ESLint, Prettier, JUnit


React/Vue (TBD, Vite-based)


Axios, GitHub Actions, Docker Compose


Minikube (local Kubernetes dev)


Tooling scripts: build-and-deploy.sh, purge-minikube.sh, forward-port.sh, curl-endpoint.sh


Milestones:
✅ May 17–20: Gateway app scaffolded, ESLint config hardened


✅ May 21–24:


Consul + PostgreSQL containers tested


Helm chart overrides integrated


Token auth + security flows scaffolded


Fully operational: purge-minikube.sh (cluster reset), forward-port.sh (auto-waits, self-heals)


curl-endpoint.sh integrated with JWT-aware headers


🔜 May 25–28: /api/test + unit tests


🔜 May 29–June 4: Frontend, Dockerization, CI pipeline setup


🔜 June 5–7: GitHub Actions (build, lint, docker, deploy)


Additions:
Hardened .gitignore


Tokenized, script-driven runtime orchestration


Smart pipeline concept: service-level triggers in CI/CD



PHASE 3 — STAGING ENVIRONMENT & QA CI/CD (June 8 – July 1)
Pipeline Plan:
CI: Trigger on dev → staging


CD: Terraform → EC2 + RDS (Postgres)


Secrets: GitHub or Vault


QA logs → Slack/email alerts


Failure blame logic (dev vs test origin)


Targets:
June 8–14: EC2 + RDS provisioning


June 15–19: GitHub Actions CI/CD staging


June 20–27: Playwright or Cypress test suite


June 28–July 1: QA alert + blame pipeline



PHASE 4 — PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BUILD & DEPLOYMENT (July 2 – August 1)
Infra:
Trigger: main merge or release tag


Deploy: AWS EKS + RDS


Secure: Vault or SSM + NGINX + HTTPS


Domain: DuckDNS or mapped custom domain


Milestones:
July 2–10: EKS + TLS + DNS


July 11–18: Vault secrets wiring


July 19–26: Full app deploy


July 27–Aug 1: Telemetry + cleanup



PHASE 5 — DOCUMENTATION, POLISH & EDGE CASE COVERAGE (Aug 2 – Aug 16)
Artifacts:
/docs/dev, /docs/staging, /docs/prod


SCRIPT_BEHAVIOR_V1.0.md, EXECUTION_WORKFLOW_DEV_V1.0.md


Diagrams: DB, CI/CD, gateway flow


SPRINT_LOG.md, RETROS.md, ERRORS_AND_LIMITATIONS.md


Edge test checklist



PHASE 6 — FINAL AUDIT & DEMO READINESS (Aug 17 – Sept 7)
Final Push:
Full environment dry-run


README → GitHub Pages or public dashboard


Resume-ready output bundle


Optional: Grafana/Prometheus load test snapshot
