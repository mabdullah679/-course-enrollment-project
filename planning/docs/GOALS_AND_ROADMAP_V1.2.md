# GOALS\_AND\_ROADMAP.md

## Project Vision

This project is a full-stack, multi-environment backend system simulating enterprise-grade infrastructure. It begins as a CLI-based Spring Boot app and evolves into a fully RESTful API system with a frontend (React/Vue), cloud-hosted database, DevOps automation, and Kubernetes orchestration.

All development adheres to real-world GitOps principles, CI/CD practices, secrets management, and production hardening. Every environment (dev, staging, prod) is fully automated with dedicated GitHub Actions pipelines.

## ‚úÖ Goals by Environment

### DEV ENVIRONMENT v1.3
    
* Scaffold gateway app and all core microservices (student, course, enrollment, grade) using JHipster

* Wire up Spring Cloud Consul for service discovery; each microservice self-registers via Docker-aware config

* Create REST endpoints and verify health via a dedicated, dev-only TestController (/api/test) in the gateway

* Secure endpoints with JWT-based Spring Security; selectively open certain endpoints (permitAll) for dev testing

* Use H2 or Docker-based PostgreSQL for local development and Liquibase for schema evolution

* Automate local runtime setup with dev.sh, reset-db.sh

* Lint, format, and dependency-upgrade automation integrated using ESLint, Prettier, and npm-check-updates

* Scaffold GitHub Actions workflows: initial focus on lint/test/build pipelines scoped to gateway and shared infra

* Postpone service-specific CI logic until all services are scaffolded, then refactor into a centralized, commit-aware pipeline

* Secrets and dev credentials managed using .env.dev, excluded via hardened .gitignore


### STAGING ENVIRONMENT

* Deploy Dockerized backend + frontend to EC2 via Terraform
* Use AWS RDS (PostgreSQL - staging instance)
* CI/CD pipeline promotes from `dev` branch merges
* Include `startup.sh`, `deploy.sh` for infra and E2E bootstrapping
* Run integration + end-to-end tests (Playwright/Cypress)
* Vault or GitHub Secrets used for sensitive config
* Implement blame resolution for staging test failures (Dev vs QA fault tagging)

### PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT

* Manual promotion via `prod-deployment.sh` or release tagging
* Backend deployed to EC2 with Kubernetes or Docker
* Frontend hosted via S3 + CloudFront or separate EC2 container
* Persistent DB on AWS RDS (PostgreSQL - prod)
* TLS via Certbot + NGINX reverse proxy
* DNS masking with DuckDNS or custom domain
* Secure secrets via Vault or AWS SSM
* GitHub Actions CD pipeline with manual approval and smoke test validation

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Monitoring & Logging Stack (Phase 6 or Later)

* Prometheus + Spring Boot Actuator
* Grafana Dashboards (self-hosted or Grafana Cloud)
* Loki for log aggregation
* Optional: Filebeat + ELK stack for extended log analysis

### Kubernetes Orchestration

* Use `minikube` for local, EKS for staging/prod
* Deploy each microservice and frontend as independent pods
* Set up NGINX Ingress with TLS and DNS routing
* Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaling and rollout strategies

### V1.3 Revisions

* Smart CI/CD Triggering via Commit Diffs or Scopes
* Introduce a centralized gateway-aware CI pipeline that dynamically:
* Detects changed microservice directories (e.g. studentApp/)
* Parses commit messages (e.g. ci:student)
* Selectively runs lint, test, Docker, and deploy stages
* Leverages GitHub Actions job matrix + conditional logic for efficient build targeting
* Ensures fault tolerance and service independence while maintaining CI simplicity

## üß© Working Style

* All feature work lives in `dev` branch
* CI/CD governs all transitions between `dev`, `staging`, and `main`
* Staging deployments are automatic upon dev merges
* Production is gated by manual triggers or tagged releases
* Documentation stored per-branch in `/docs` (dev, staging, prod)
* Planning and architectural notes live in `/planning` (if needed)
